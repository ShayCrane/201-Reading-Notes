### SOP = standard operating procedure
    - procedure that is specific to a company/ organization 
    - describes activities necessary to complete a particular task

    **Policy** = Answers *Why?* (broad)
    **SOP** =            *What, when and why?* (specific, can have multiple SOP's that support one specific policy)
    **Work Instructions** = *How?* (aka: WI)


### Why are SOP's Important?
    - they steer organization to achieve mission/goals
        makes the goals actionable
    - compliance

- SOP's have no hard rules for writing them/format varies org by orb

- must be maintained and kept up to date in a quickly changing world


### Make a Plan for Writing an SOP

- start with a simple flowchart mapping the activities of the procedure from beginning to end (provides scope of SOP and confirms sequence of activities)

- make it concise by combining closely related topics


### Five Guiding Principles

1. Keep it simple; 
1. SOPs must be portable (even if underpinning app changes);
1. Flowcharts, diagrams tell a story; 
1. Consistency counts (re: format, make a template); and
1. It's about the audience (write for easy understanding for the audience of the SOP).
