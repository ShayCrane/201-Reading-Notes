### **What is this repo all about?**
*This repo contains my submissions to the daily Ops Challenge assignments throughout course 201 in the Ops and Cybersecurity program taught by my instructors at Code Fellows.* <br><br>

### **Why am I learning these skills?**
*I am determined to build a career in cybersecurity, a stable and in-demand field of work that I truly enjoy performing, with a mission that I believe in. There is a lot out there that needs securing and I look forward to being a part of it all.* <br><br>

### **What fundamental concepts did I learn in Ops 201?**
- *I created and documented shell scripts of increasing complexity using **Bash** and **PowerShell***  
><br>*I write scripts that utilize useful **system management** commands/cmdlets/expressions, such as:<br><br>variables, functions, pipelines, arrays, loops, conditionals, manipulation of system files, batch scripting, filtration of results, analyzation of web domains, and more.* <br><br>

- *I use **Visual Studio Code** to apply the Add-Commit-Push workflow of scripts to **GitHub**.*<br><br>

- *I have written scripts in the **Linux Terminal** and **Windows PowerShell** that perform the same actions in a given file system.*<br><br>

- *I can "spin up" a multitude of **virtual machines** using utilities like **VirtualBox** and **cloud computing** systems like **Amazon Web Services** for purposes of troubleshooting a wide range of computer issues, from bad configurations to finding and extracting malware.*<br>
><br>*Examples of virtual machines I've built:*
**Windows 10**, **Ubuntu** servers, **Windows** servers, and more.*<br><br>

<br>

### **What was my favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?**
*I enjoy scripting in **PowerShell**.  Once I wrapped my head around its purpose, I found an appreciation for its build and use. Any challenge using PowerShell was like an **adventure and a learning journey** for me.*<br><br> 

### **How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?**
*The scripts I've learned how to write are useful in the workplace for the **administration** of enterprise networks, **user management**, **resource management**, and protection from/detection of **malicious cyber attacks** and exploitation.*<br><br>

### **What scripts would I continue to improve if I had the time?**
*PowerShell scripts that pull system information and filter the output to show only the data that's pertinent to the task at hand.  **I intend to become an expert at PowerShell.***<br><br>


### **What aspect of my shell scripting skillset do I hope to improve next?**
*I intend to become proficient in shell script for the purpose of **expediency and efficiency** through the memorization of the **useful expressions**, in order **to be an asset** to my future employer and/or clients.*<br><br>
