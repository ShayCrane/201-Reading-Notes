is best practice to include README files in repos = use Markdown (language used for documentation). 
link to Markdown cheatsheet: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

2. branches = to work on the repo without changing the core work. It's kind of like saving a copy of a digital work-of-art-in-progress and working on the copy with something experimental so as not to mess up the original. 

3. commits = saved changes to repos/branches in GitHub. 
best practice to include "commit message" = description and explanation of changes made for posterity and for others' understanding.

4. pull requests =	proposing your changes be made to branch.
requesting review, feedback.
requesting merge to associated branch.
once commit is made, you can open pull request.
diffs btwn content of current branch and proposed branch are shown in pull request through color coding

offers extensions for other languages not listed above

Shellshock
A link to a great article on Wired.com about the Shellshock vulnerability in open source code.  This answered a question that runs through my mind every time I use a tool that is open source, or apply an open source plugin to said tool (like GIMP, for example, which I have used heavily in the past).  Brian Fox should still be proud of his important contributions.
