 ## [How to Troubleshoot - CompTIA A+ 220-902 - 5.5](https://www.example.com)

 > *my notes below are a recap of the steps laid out in the video accompanying the link above.*

**All information gathered and steps taken while troubleshooting *must* be *documented* for *each step listed below*:**

## The Troubleshooting Process


1. Identify the problem 
    - info gathering = details, duplicate issue if possible
    - identify symptoms = usually more than a single symptom
    - question users = best source of details
    - determine if anything has changed = (wiring closet?)
    - approach multiple problems individually = break down into smaller steps

1. Establish a theory of what is most likely causing the problem. 

        *occam's razor applies (simplest explanation likely the cause)*
    - consider everything = even not-so-obvious
     - make list of all possible causes = 
       - easy theories first
       - least difficult to test

1. Test the theory
   - confirm the theory = determine next steps to resolve
    - if theory did't work 
        - new theory or escalate 
        - call an expert



1. Create a plan of action
   - Build the plan =
        - correct the issue with minimal impact
        - some issues can't be resolved during production hours (office hours, hours of operation, etc)

   - Identify potential effects = 
        - every plan can go bad
        - have a plan B, plan c

1. Implement the solution 
   - Fix the issue =
        - implement during change control window
        - Escalate as necessary
            - you may need help from a 3rd party

1. Verify full system functionality
    *it's not fixed until it's really fixed.*
    - test should be part of your plan
    - have your customer confirm the fix

    - implement preventative measures =
        - let's avoid this issue in the future.

1. DOCUMENT FINDINGS
    - (it's not over until you) 
    - build the knowledge base =
        - don't lose valuable knowledge gained during the troubleshooting process!

    - consider a formal database =
        - help desk case notes
        - searchable database

    the meaning of change control window - look up more info
